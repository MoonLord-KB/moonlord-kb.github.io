<p>According to a new research report by three economists from the International Department of the Federal Reserve, the excessive savings accumulated by the United States during the pandemic have been exhausted. However, this does not mean that Americans have stopped saving, but their savings are now below the trend level in several ways. The report also states that other advanced economies, including Canada, France, and Germany, have also experienced a "hump-shaped path", but their excess savings are not expected to be depleted before the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>Although the cost of excessive savings is current inflation, the researchers pointed out the benefits of COVID-19 aid. They stated that the large-scale fiscal transfers implemented by governments have supported a strong economic rebound, with GDP and employment recovering at an astonishing speed, which may prevent worse outcomes. The Deutsche Bank expanded on the Fed's analysis and found that savings in Sweden have been consumed more.</p>

<p>They concluded that the US economy will slow down the fastest in the second half of the year, and the Fed is closer to easing policies compared to most other central banks in the G10 group. Additionally, although the UK and the Eurozone may persist longer due to excess savings, the lack of excess savings supports the view that Sweden will face greater headwinds.</p>
