<p>Uber Early Investor: Silicon Valley Remains the Holy Land of Entrepreneurship Bill Gurley, who made a fortune by betting on Uber in its early days, believes that Silicon Valley is still the top choice for anyone looking to start a tech company. Despite now living in Austin, Texas, Gurley is adamant that the California region has not lost its edge.</p>

<p>The debate over whether Silicon Valley is still the epicenter of American entrepreneurship has been ongoing since the outbreak of the pandemic. Gurley's opinion remains unchanged: "If I were young, say 22, and wanted to start a company, I would definitely go to Silicon Valley. The reason is that it increases the chances of success."Â </p>
