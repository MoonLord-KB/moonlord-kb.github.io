<div class="article_content">
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk indirectly confirmed during the company's Q2 earnings call that Nvidia's trillion-dollar valuation isn't solely driven by hype around artificial intelligence. Musk revealed that he was willing to invest over $1 billion in developing an AI supercomputer called Dojo for Tesla because he couldn't get enough Nvidia chips. He needs Nvidia's advanced A100 tensor core GPU cluster to train his Full Self-Driving (FSD) software and the Optimus humanoid robot he's developing.</p>

<p>Musk stated that if Nvidia could provide enough GPUs, they might not need Dojo, but Nvidia has too many customers to fulfill their demand. The huge demand for AI chips from Tesla seems to surpass nearly all competitors. Musk praised Nvidia's CEO and thanked the company for prioritizing Tesla's orders. Musk further commented on Twitter that unfortunately, Nvidia couldn't even provide a small fraction of the required computing power.Â </p>
