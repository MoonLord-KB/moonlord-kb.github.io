<p>5 Surprising Ways to Repurpose Damaged Socks</p>

<p>1. Triple Your Closet Space - Cut off the toe section of the sock and fold it twice lengthwise. Cut out a sock ring about 1 cm wide and place it on a hanger. You can now hang 5 or 6 hangers vertically, significantly increasing your closet space.</p>

<p>2. Hair Bun Maker - For those with long hair, you can create your own hair bun maker with an old sock. Cut open the front of a clean sock and roll it inside out, creating a donut-shaped fabric ball. Use it to twist and hold your hair in a bun, securing it with a clip or hairpin.</p>

<p>3. Find Lost Jewelry - To easily find small jewelry items like rings and earrings that fall into tight spaces or couches, cover the vacuum cleaner nozzle with a sock. Vacuum the area, and the jewelry will stick to the sock for easy retrieval.</p>

<p>4. DIY Neck Pillow - Make your own neck pillow by filling two socks with cotton and sewing them together. Customize it with your preferred decorations. This homemade neck pillow will provide comfort and relieve neck pain during long computer usage.</p>

<p>5. Wardrobe Moisture Absorber and Odor Eliminator - Place a bar of soap inside a sock and put it in your wardrobe. The soap will absorb moisture, prevent odors, and act as a natural insect repellent. When the soap becomes too small to use, collect them and put them inside a sock for easy use as a scrubber.</p>
