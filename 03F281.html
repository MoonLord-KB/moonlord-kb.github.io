<p>YouTube Raises Prices for Premium Plans in the US Since 2018 Launch YouTube, the video streaming platform owned by Google, has increased the monthly and annual fees for its premium plans in the US for the first time since its subscription service was introduced in 2018. Specifically, the monthly fee has risen by $2 to $13.99, while the annual fee has increased by $20 to $139.99. YouTube stated that members who subscribed five years ago, including those who initially registered through Google Play, will continue to enjoy the pre-price hike plans for an additional three months.</p>

<p>In April this year, YouTube introduced new features for its premium users, including the ability to host Google Meet meetings and watch videos together on the platform. Additionally, the company has raised the price of YouTube Music in the United States by $1 to $10.99. Prior to this price increase, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Tidal had already adjusted their prices.Â </p>
