<p>Biden Calls for Options to Prevent Debt Ceiling Crisis The White House announced on Thursday that US President Biden has asked a group of aides to research "all legal and policy options" to prevent a debt ceiling standoff from happening again. In late May, after months of difficult negotiations, both parties in the US reached a debt ceiling agreement, avoiding a potential unprecedented default crisis.</p>

<p>The agreement maintains spending for the 2024 fiscal year at current levels and allows for a 1% increase in spending for the 2025 fiscal year. The White House statement revealed that the group, led by White House Counsel Stuart Delery and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, will study potential actions Congress can take to make the risk of default a thing of the past. The group's members also include Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Attorney General Merrick Garland, White House Budget Director Shalanda Young, and Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers Jared Bernstein. The group will consult with four legal scholars, including Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe and Seth Carpenter, the global chief economist at Morgan Stanley, in their first meeting.Â </p>
