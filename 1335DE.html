<div class="article_content">
<p>Alibaba rose 4.54% as Ant Group announced its plan to repurchase shares. A recent announcement from Alibaba revealed the latest progress of the share repurchase. On July 23, Alibaba announced that it had received a notification from its non-consolidated affiliated company, Ant Group, that the proposal to repurchase no more than 7.6% of the shares had been approved at the shareholders' meeting.</p>

<p>Importantly, Alibaba, which holds a 33% stake in Ant Group, will not participate in this repurchase, indicating that it does not intend to reduce its influence on Ant Group. The two companies have been closely involved in business transactions. In the fiscal year 2023, Alibaba paid a total of 14.755 billion yuan to Ant Group and its affiliates, a decrease of nearly 4% compared to the previous year. The payment for services accounted for approximately 85% of Alibaba's total expenditures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Ant Group and its affiliates paid Alibaba 11.805 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 21% from the previous year. The cloud services provided by Alibaba to Ant Group are the largest and fastest growing business. Alibaba's decision not to participate in the share repurchase indicates its strategic partnership with Ant Group. The article states that the companies are finding ways to separate their operations while maintaining a certain level of business collaboration.Â </p>
