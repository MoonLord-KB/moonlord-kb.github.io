<div class="article_content">
<p>In a most unusual day on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its ninth consecutive day of gains, while the Nasdaq plummeted. This stark contrast is not entirely surprising, considering the Nasdaq's significant 34.4% year-to-date increase compared to the Dow's modest 6.3%.</p>

<p>The rise of AI and the subsequent surge in tech stocks has become the norm this year. However, last night, the tables seemed to turn. The Dow Jones closed up approximately 160 points, a 0.5% increase, marking the longest winning streak since September 2017. In contrast, the S&P 500 fell 0.7%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped a staggering 2.1%.</p>
