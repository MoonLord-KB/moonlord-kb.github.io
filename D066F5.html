<div class="article_content">
<p>NASDAQ will conduct a special rebalance of the NASDAQ 100 Index next week, with the last trading day before the adjustment being tonight. The rebalance aims to address the issue of excessive concentration in the index by redistributing weights. If the total weight of large companies with a weight of 4.5% or more in the index exceeds 48%, a special rebalance can be requested until their total weight in the index does not exceed 40%. The rebalance may lead to passive investors adjusting their portfolios to match the index.</p>

<p>As the rebalance approaches, stocks facing weight reductions have underperformed in recent trading days. It is estimated that this special rebalance could result in a bidirectional trading volume of up to $60 billion. Considering the rebalance and the expiration of options contracts on Friday, there is a possibility of market volatility and increased trading volume tonight.Â </p>
