<p>Tesla temporarily peaked? UBS downgrades rating to "neutral": waiting for the debut of autonomous driving UBS downgraded Tesla's rating to "neutral" on Monday. UBS believes that with Tesla's valuation of nearly $1 trillion and a strong rise of 148% so far this year, many good news have already been digested in advance. UBS stated, "We downgrade the rating to neutral because we believe the recent strong stock performance has fully reflected the strong demand response after price cuts." About a week ago, Tesla released its second-quarter financial report.</p>

<p>Despite the company's profits and revenue exceeding expectations, the decline in gross margin of its automotive business caused the stock to fall more than 10%. Nevertheless, UBS remains optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects and has raised its 12-month target price from $220 to $270, reflecting a potential increase of about 3% from the current level. UBS said, "We continue to believe that Tesla leads the competition in affordable electric vehicles and autonomous driving globally. From a one-year perspective, the risk/return seems balanced."</p>

<p>However, Tesla still faces many risks as it increases spending to ramp up production of its newly launched Cybertruck by 2024, and continues to develop alternatives to Nvidia chips through its Dojo supercomputer. UBS stated that for Tesla to create more value for investors, it needs to generate more profits, which is unlikely to happen until the company makes progress in autonomous driving technology. Key Questions to Watch: 1. Can Tesla achieve its 50% growth target? 2. Can Tesla maintain its leading position in the competition? 3. Can Tesla achieve full self-driving within the next 12 months?  </p>
