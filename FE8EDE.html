<p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been actively involved in economic and capital market activities to accelerate economic growth. The country aims to double its GDP to over $800 billion by the end of this decade. Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, UAE's Minister of Economy, stated in an interview that they aim to double the economy by 2030, reaching AED 3 trillion ($817 billion) with a focus on achieving 7% annual growth. According to official data, the UAE's GDP in 2022 was AED 1.62 trillion, a 7.9% YoY growth, partially due to higher oil prices and production. However, Al Marri also highlighted that challenges like global financial instability could pose risks. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecasted a GDP growth rate of 3.5% for the UAE this year.Â </p>
